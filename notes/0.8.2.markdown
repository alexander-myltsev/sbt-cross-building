This version is a maintenance release. Note that this will be the last version
supporting building *from* sbt 0.11.x because it doesn't support Scala 2.10 (!)
and therefore cannot build for sbt 0.13.

Fixes:

  * [#28] Build 0.13 version of this plugin against 0.13.2
  * [#29] Don't add `scala-sbt-0.13.null` source directories.
  * Build 0.13 plugins against recently released sbt 0.13.2
