This version adds support for building _from_ sbt 0.13. From now on you can publish 0.11.x or 0.12
plugins from a 0.13 build ([#23][]).

Other changes:
  * introduced `latestCompatibleVersionMapper` setting which allows to customize which concrete version the
    plugin should choose for a binary compatible one (e.g. build against "0.13.1-RC2" instead of "0.13.0" when using
    `^^0.13`).
